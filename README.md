# Vampire Elimination
Command Line Prompt game which implements the fundamental concepts of OOP with Java. Techniques from OOP like Polymorphism and Inheritance with functions and methods from classes--Poison, Vampire, Player--to generate a display and allow players to move around. 

The “Game.java” class is the main class, so run the game through that. How the game works is that you’re the “@” symbol and the “V” are the vampires. You are trying to navigate the course and drop poisons onto the floor and so when the vampires hit the poison they die. But if you move, and the vampire moves to the same place as you, then you lose a life. The goal of the game is to eliminate all the vampires before you lose all your lives. 

Extra: the “2” symbol means there’s two vampires sitting in the same place. The “X” symbol means a vampire died at that certain spot in the arena.
